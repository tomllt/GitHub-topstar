# security-audit

A coding-agent skill that turns your agent into a security auditor. It orchestrates isolated agents through reconnaissance, coverage-led hunting, candidate validation, structured output, independent record verification, and target-neutral reporting.

This is the skill that seeded Cloudflare's vulnerability discovery harness, described in [Build your own vulnerability harness](https://blog.cloudflare.com/build-your-own-vulnerability-harness). The harness grew into a multi-stage, fleet-wide system; this skill is the single-repo starting point it evolved from.

## What it does

The skill runs a structured audit in six phases:

1. **Reconnaissance** -- map architecture, trust boundaries, input surfaces, prior evidence, and deterministic coverage in `architecture.md` and `coverage-ledger.json`.
2. **Coverage-led hunting** -- assign isolated hunters from ledger units, record their checks, and use coverage critics to find gaps.
3. **Candidate validation** -- give every unique candidate to a fresh verifier that tries to disprove it.
4. **Structured output** -- write `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, and `rejected` records to `findings.json` and validate them against `report-schema.json`.
5. **Independent record verification** -- fresh agents verify final source claims. Material replacements receive another independent verifier.
6. **Target-neutral reporting** -- derive `REPORT.md`, `FINDINGS-DETAIL.md`, and `NEEDS-VALIDATION.md` from the verified records and coverage ledger.

The parent runs `validate-coverage-ledger.cjs` after creating the ledger and after each later ledger update. It runs `validate-findings.cjs` in Phase 4 and again after every Phase 5 replacement.

The verdicts are distinct: `confirmed` has a complete source trace and bounded observed result, `needs_validation` has an exact unresolved fact and no severity, and `rejected` records a disproved candidate.

Multiple runs against the same repo are additive. The skill uses prior ledgers and fin
