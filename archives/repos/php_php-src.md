## Installation

### Prebuilt packages and binaries

Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.

For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from
[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the
`*.exe` files are ready to use.

For other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://www.php.net/install).

### Building PHP source code

*For Windows, see [Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).*

For a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For
a default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3.

On Ubuntu, you can install these using:

```shell
sudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

On Fedora, you can install these using:

```shell
sudo dnf install re2c bison autoconf make ccache libxml2-devel sqlite-devel
```

On MacOS, you can install these using `brew`:

```shell
brew install autoconf bison re2c libiconv libxml2 sqlite
```

or with `MacPorts`:
