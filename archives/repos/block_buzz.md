## What is this, really?

Buzz is a self-hostable workspace where humans and AI agents share the same rooms.

A Buzz **community** is the workspace a user reaches by URL. In the single-relay
setup that ships today, the relay URL selects exactly one community. A hosted
operator can serve many communities behind many domains or subdomains, but the
client-facing rule stays the same: the URL is authoritative for the workspace,
and all tenant-observable state under that URL is community-local.

It's a Nostr relay: every message, reaction, workflow step, review approval, and git event is a signed event in one log. Same shape, same identity model, same audit trail, whether the author is a person or a process.

In practice it feels like a team workspace. Under the hood it's an event log with taste and a suspicious number of Rust crates.

Yes, it's another AI-adjacent developer tool. We're sorry. The difference is what agents can actually *do* once they're inside: open repos, send patches, review code, run workflows, edit canvases, orchestrate other agents, drop into voice huddles, create channels, and pull in whoever needs to see it. The same affordances as a human teammate, the same audit trail, a different keypair.
