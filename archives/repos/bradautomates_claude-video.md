# /watch

**Give Claude the ability to watch any video.**

Claude Code (recommended — auto-updates via marketplace):
```
/plugin marketplace add bradautomates/claude-video
/plugin install watch@claude-video
```

Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, or any of 50+ [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) hosts:
```bash
npx skills add bradautomates/claude-video -g
```
(`-g` installs globally for your user, available across all projects. Drop it to scope per-project.)

More install options (claude.ai web, manual) in the [Install](#install) section below.

Zero config to start — `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` install on first run via `brew` on macOS (Linux/Windows print exact commands). Captions cover most public videos for free. Whisper API key is only needed when a video has no captions.

Claude can read a webpage, run a script, browse a repo. What it can't do, out of the box, is *watch a video*. You paste a YouTube link and it has to either guess from the title or pull a transcript that's missing 90% of what's on screen.

With Claude Video `/watch` you can paste a URL or a local path, ask a question, and Claude fetches captions first, downloads only what it needs, extracts frames (scene-aware, or fast keyframes at `efficient` detail), pulls a timestamped transcript (free captions when available, Whisper API as fallback), and `Read`s every frame as an image. By the time it answers, it has *seen* the video and *heard* the audio.

## What people actually use it for

**Analyze someone else's content.** `/watch https://youtu.be/<viral-video> what hook did they open with?` Claude looks at the first frames, reads the opening transcript, breaks down the structure. Same for ad creative, competitor launches, podcast intros, anything where the *how* matters as much as the *what*.

**Diagnose a bug from a video.** Someone sends you a screen recording of something broken. `/watch bug-repro.mov what's going w
