PersonaPlex is a real-time, full-duplex speech-to-speech conversational model that enables persona control through text-based role prompts and audio-based voice conditioning. Trained on a combination of synthetic and real conversations, it produces natural, low-latency spoken interactions with a consistent persona. PersonaPlex is based on the [Moshi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037) architecture and weights.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Install the [Opus audio codec](https://github.com/xiph/opus) development library:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libopus-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install opus-devel
```

### Installation

Download this repository and install with:
```bash
pip install moshi/.
```

Extra step for Blackwell based GPUs as suggested in (See https://github.com/NVIDIA/personaplex/issues/2):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```


### Accept Model License
Log in to your Huggingface account and accept the PersonaPlex model license [here](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/personaplex-7b-v1). <br>
Then set up your Huggingface authentication:
```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>
```

### Launch Server

Launch server for live interaction (temporary SSL certs for https):
```bash
SSL_DIR=$(mktemp -d); python -m moshi.server --ssl "$SSL_DIR"
```
