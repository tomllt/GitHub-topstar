### Core concepts:

1. [**Agents**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents): LLMs configured with instructions, tools, guardrails, and handoffs
1. [**Sandbox Agents**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/sandbox_agents): Agents preconfigured to work with a container to perform work over long time horizons.
1. **[Agents as tools](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tools/#agents-as-tools) / [Handoffs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/)**: Delegating to other agents for specific tasks
1. [**Tools**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tools/): Various Tools let agents take actions (functions, MCP, hosted tools)
1. [**Guardrails**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/guardrails/): Configurable safety checks for input and output validation
1. [**Human in the loop**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/human_in_the_loop/): Built-in mechanisms for involving humans across agent runs
1. [**Sessions**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/sessions/): Automatic conversation history management across agent runs
1. [**Tracing**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tracing/): Built-in tracking of agent runs, allowing you to view, debug and optimize your workflows
1. [**Realtime Agents**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/realtime/quickstart/): Build powerful
