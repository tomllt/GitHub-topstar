# DESIGN.md

A format specification for describing a visual identity to coding agents. DESIGN.md gives agents a persistent, structured understanding of a design system.

## The Format

A DESIGN.md file combines machine-readable design tokens (YAML front matter) with human-readable design rationale (markdown prose). Tokens give agents exact values. Prose tells them *why* those values exist and how to apply them.

## Overview

Architectural Minimalism meets Journalistic Gravitas. The UI evokes a
premium matte finish — a high-end broadsheet or contemporary gallery.

## Colors

The palette is rooted in high-contrast neutrals and a single accent color.

- **Primary (#1A1C1E):** Deep ink for headlines and core text.
- **Secondary (#6C7278):** Sophisticated slate for borders, captions, metadata.
- **Tertiary (#B8422E):** "Boston Clay" — the sole driver for interaction.
- **Neutral (#F7F5F2):** Warm limestone foundation, softer than pure white.
```

An agent that reads this file will produce a UI with deep ink headlines in Public Sans, a warm limestone background, and Boston Clay call-to-action buttons.

## Getting Started

Validate a DESIGN.md against the spec, catch broken token references, check WCAG contrast ratios, and surface structural findings — all as structured JSON that agents can act on.

```bash
npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md
```

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "warning",
      "path": "components.button-primary",
      "message": "textColor (#ffffff) on backgroundColor (#1A1C1E) has contrast ratio 15.42:1 — passes WCAG AA."
    }
  ],
  "summary": { "errors": 0, "warnin
