# Agent Skills

A collection of agent skills that extend capabilities across planning, development, and tooling.

## Planning & Design

These skills help you think through problems before writing code.

- **to-prd** — Turn the current conversation context into a PRD and submit it as a GitHub issue. No interview — just synthesizes what you've already discussed.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/to-prd
  ```

- **to-issues** — Break any plan, spec, or PRD into independently-grabbable GitHub issues using vertical slices.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/to-issues
  ```

- **grill-me** — Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the decision tree is resolved.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/grill-me
  ```

- **design-an-interface** — Generate multiple radically different interface designs for a module using parallel sub-agents.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/design-an-interface
  ```

- **request-refactor-plan** — Create a detailed refactor plan with tiny commits via user interview, then file it as a GitHub issue.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/request-refactor-plan
  ```

## Development

These skills help you write, refactor, and fix code.

- **tdd** — Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/tdd
  ```

- **triage-issue** — Investigate a bug by exploring the codebase, identify the root cause, and file a GitHub issue with a TDD-based fix plan.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/triage-issue
  ```

- **improve-codebase-architecture** — Find deepening opportunities in a codebase, informed by the domain language in `CONTEXT.md` and the decisions in `docs/adr/`.

  ```
  npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills/improve-codebase-architecture
  ```

- **migrate-to-shoehorn** — Migrate test files from `as` type assertions to @to
